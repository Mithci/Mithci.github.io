## **What is Mobile Legend?**

[Mobile Legends: Bang Bang](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobile.legends&hl=en&gl=US) is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) developed and published by Moonton. Released in 2016, the game has become popular in Southeast Asia and was among the games chosen for the first medal event esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines.

*In each team, there are five players who each control a character, known as a "hero" using analog/joystick controls. Heroes can be grouped into 6 different roles, Marksman, Assassin, Mage, Support, Fighter, and Tank.*

**Features:**

1. Classic MOBA Maps & 5v5 Battles 
Real-time 5v5 battles against real players. 3 lanes, 4 jungle areas, 2 bosses, 18 defense towers, and endless fights, everything a classic MOBA has is here!

2. Win with Teamwork & Strategy 
Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team and be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!

3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory 
Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Skill and strategy are all you need to be able to win the intense competition on this fair and balanced platform. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.

4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master 
With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target switching allow you to last hit to your heart’s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system allows you to buy equipment anywhere on the map so you can focus more on the thrill of battle!

5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches 
Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds. And a match only takes 10 minutes. Gloss over the quiet early-game leveling up and jump right into the intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling actions and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in the heart-pounding MOBA competition.

6. Smart Offline AI Assistance 
A dropped connection could mean hanging your team out to dry in an intense match, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang’s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you’re offline, our AI system will take control of your character temporarily to avoid a 4-on-5 situation.

## IV. Ranked, Classic, Arcade,Brawl, VS A.I. Custom, Training Camp

Mobile Legends features a ranked system, but players can also find tournaments to compete in, which increases the level of competition throughout the game. Even if you’re not aiming for glory, playing ranked matches will allow you to play with players from the same skill tier as you. 

*Before you can step foot into the ranked mode, you’ll need to get your account to level eight and unlock at least six heroes. Once you complete these requirements, you’ll be able to start your journey from the Warrior rank.
When you win a ranked Mobile Legends match, you’ll be awarded a star, but a defeat will mean you’ll lose a star. Once you collect all the stars in a division, you’ll advance to the next tier. Players who don’t have any stars left in their rank will be demoted to a rank below after losing.*
